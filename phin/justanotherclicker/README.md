# just another clicker game
## a final project for my java OOP class.

### what is this?
this is a simple clicker-style game I developed in java for my java OOP class. it's nothing really special, its not a "complete" game per say, more like a tech demo.
the game includes a dynamic UI that slightly changes as conditions change (e.g. if you can afford an upgrade, your click count, etc.)

### playing the game
playing the game is very simple - you click on a big button, get upgrades, click some more, and get even more upgrades.


### running
using intelliJ:
- select open, then navigate to the cloned project. ensure you installed the java + javaFX SDK.
- locate the Main.java file in src/main/java/com/example/justanotherclicker
- right click the Main.java file and click "Run Main.main()"
- the game should be running!!

you will need to ensure javaFX is configured within intelliJ as well.
