Welcome to my Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class repository!  
This repo contains a collection of projects, assignments, and practice exercises created as part of my coursework.

## Overview

Each project in this repository demonstrates key principles of object-oriented programming using Java, including:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**
- **Interfaces**
- **Exception Handling**
- **File I/O**
- **Basic GUI (if applicable)**

Whether you're a fellow student, a developer browsing for examples, or someone learning Java, feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning.

## Folder Structure

Each project is contained in its own directory and typically includes:

- Java source files (`.java`)
- A `README` or comment documentation (if applicable)
- Sample input/output (for projects that require it)

## License

This code is shared for educational purposes. Feel free to fork, clone, and adapt for your own learning or reference.
